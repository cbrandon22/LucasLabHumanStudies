The two algorithms implemented in this software package are described in detail in the paper:

A. Tsanas, G.D. Clifford: "Stage-independent, single lead EEG sleep spindle detection using the continuous wavelet transform and local weighted smoothing", Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 9:181, 2015

Please cite that study if you find this tool useful for your work.
